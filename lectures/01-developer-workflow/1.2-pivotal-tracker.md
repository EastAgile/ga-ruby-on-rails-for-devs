Pivotal Tracker
===============

We'll use [Pivotal Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/) for tracking exercises and assignments.

* Give a workitem 1, 2 or 3 points depending on the level of difficulty you estimate the workitem is.
* *Start* a workitem when you begin working on it.
* *Finish* a workitem when you have committed code into Github.
* *Deliver* the workitem when you want your instructor to look at it.
* Your instructor will *Accept* or *Reject* an assignment. You can *Restart* rejected assignments.
